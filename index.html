                        Welcome to my website, I'm Taiyo Holland. I'm a dedicated student and budding 
                        coder with a focus on web development. Over the past few years, I've been 
                        building my skills in Python, CSS, and HTML, creating projects that transform 
                        ideas into functional, interactive experiences. Recently, I've been expanding 
                        into JavaScript and C#, which has opened up new opportunities for growth and 
                        creativity. Here, you'll find a selection of my work, each project a step in my 
                        journey as a developer. I invite you to explore and see how I'm shaping my skills 
                        and refining my craft. Scroll down to view some of my previous work.

                                Explore my collection of projects! Each piece in this portfolio showcases 
                                my journey as a student coder, where I've worked with languages like Python,
                                CSS, and HTML to build engaging, functional web experiences. From developing 
                                foundational skills to experimenting with JavaScript and C#, each project reflects
                                both my learning process and my enthusiasm for creating something meaningful through
                                code. This portfolio highlights not only what I've achieved so far but also the
                                path I'm taking to grow as a developer. Dive in, and get a closer look at how I'm

                        I'm Taiyo Holland, a student with a passion for programming and a focus on
                        web development. With experience in Python, CSS, and HTML, and a growing 
                        knowledge of JavaScript and C#, I'm driven to learn and build creative solutions
                        through code. While I have dabbled in graphic design, my main priority is developing 
                        as a coder, tackling projects that challenge me and help expand my skill set. 
                        As I continue to learn, I'm excited to see where coding takes me, and I'm always
                        eager to take on new challenges that push my abilities to the next level.
