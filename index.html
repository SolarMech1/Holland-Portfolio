            Welcome to my website, I'm Taiyo Holland. I'm a dedicated student and budding 
            coder with a focus on web development. Over the past few years, I've been 
            building my skills in Python, CSS, and HTML, creating projects that transform 
            ideas into functional, interactive experiences. Recently, I've been expanding 
            into JavaScript and C#, which has opened up new opportunities for growth and 
            creativity. Here, you'll find a selection of my work, each project a step in my 
            journey as a developer. I invite you to explore and see how I'm shaping my skills 
            and refining my craft. Scroll down to view some of my previous work.

            Explore my collection of projects! Each piece in this portfolio showcases 
            my journey as a student coder, where I've worked with languages like Python,
            CSS, and HTML to build engaging, functional web experiences. From developing 
            foundational skills to experimenting with JavaScript and C#, each project reflects
            both my learning process and my enthusiasm for creating something meaningful through
            code. This portfolio highlights not only what I've achieved so far but also the
            path I'm taking to grow as a developer. Dive in, and get a closer look at how I'm
            crafting my skills, one project at a time.

            I'm Taiyo Holland, a student with a passion for programming and a focus on
            web development. With experience in Python, CSS, and HTML, and a growing 
            knowledge of JavaScript and C#, I'm driven to learn and build creative solutions
            through code. While I have dabbled in graphic design, my main priority is developing 
            as a coder, tackling projects that challenge me and help expand my skill set. 
            As I continue to learn, I'm excited to see where coding takes me, and I'm always
            eager to take on new challenges that push my abilities to the next level.
